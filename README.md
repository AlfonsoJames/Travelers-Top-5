### The Repository
This repository is where we develop the Traveler's Top 5 application. We ([Alfonso James](https://github.com/AlfonsoJames), [Gabriella Miller-Eakin](https://github.com/gabriellamiller-eakin), [Caitlin Crews](https://github.com/caitlincrews08), [Benjamin Phan](https://github.com/bphan94), and [Nathan Anthony](https://github.com/Pegasoos)) built this application to help people conveniently find the five best reviewed locations and activities in a given city and the means to fly there.
## Traveler's Top 5
Traveler's Top 5 is a mobile first web application that utilizes the Yelp API to help users discover locations based on review ranking to visit within the city they enter. It also uses the Skyscanner API to help users find cheap flights and hotels to travel on/to once they have decided their destination.
